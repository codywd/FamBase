## Typography

### Recommended (mobile friendly)

* **iOS:** SF Pro (system)
* **Android:** Roboto (system)

* H1: 24–28 semibold (screen title)
* H2: 18–20 semibold (section headers like “Pickups”)
* Body: 15–17 regular
* Caption: 12–13 regular (metadata like “Added by Cody”)

### Rules

* Prefer sentence case: “Due today”, not “DUE TODAY”.
* Keep line length readable in cards.

---

## UI style

### Shape language

* Rounded rectangles for cards and chips
* Consistent corner radius (example: 12 for cards, 16 for chips)

### Elevation

* Subtle shadows, or none if you go fully flat
* Emphasize separation using spacing and dividers rather than heavy shadows

### Components

**Board Cards**

* Each section is a card stack
* Card header: title + optional “See all”
* Card body: 3–5 items max, then “View more”

**Status Chips**

* Planned, En route, Done
* Each with icon + text

**Primary actions**

* “+” global quick add
* Inline “Add event”, “Add item” in Board sections for speed

## Iconography

### Style

* Rounded, consistent stroke weight
* Simple shapes, no detailed illustrations

### Key icons

* Board: grid
* Calendar: calendar
* Chores: check-circle
* Lists: list/checklist
* Pickup: car or location-pin (keep it friendly, not “taxi app”)

---

## Imagery (optional)

If you use illustrations:

* Minimal, warm, inclusive silhouettes
* No stock-photo “perfect family” vibes
* Focus on objects and moments (backpack, calendar, groceries), not faces

---

## Accessibility and inclusion baked into brand

* Neutral labels: caregiver, guardian, member, guest
* Color palette supports high contrast
* Support Dynamic Type and large tap targets
* “Kid mode” option (bigger UI, simplified Board view)
* Low-stimulation mode (reduced motion, fewer animations)

---

## Pickups on the Board: branding specifics

Since Pickups is a Board section (not its own tab), it should feel like a “status strip” not a separate feature.

### Pickup card copy examples

* “Pickup: Delilah at Dance, 6:00 PM”
* “Unassigned. Claim pickup?”
* “Cody claimed pickup”
* “Status: En route”

### One-tap actions

* Claim
* Mark En route
* Mark Done

Keep it calm, factual, and easy to scan.

---

## App Store and marketing basics

### App Store subtitle ideas

* “Schedules, chores, lists, pickup plans”
* “Your family’s daily dashboard”
* “One shared board for home life”

### 3 feature bullets (store listing)

* Board-first daily dashboard
* Shared lists and recurring chores
* Pickup plans with one-tap claiming

### Screenshot callouts (simple)

1. “Everything important today”
2. “Shared lists that actually stay updated”
3. “Pickups without the text storm”
4. “Chores with clear ownership”

---

## Do / Don’t cheat sheet

### Do

* Make the Board feel calm and uncluttered.
* Use friendly, neutral language.
* Design for one-handed use.
* Keep “quick add” obvious.

### Don’t

* Add chat as a core feature (text storms are the enemy).
* Shame users with streaks or red alerts everywhere.
* Hide key actions in menus.
