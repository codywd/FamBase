## Main app screens (MVP)

Below is a practical screen map for v1 that stays lean, fast, and “10-second update” friendly.

### Navigation model

**Bottom tabs (5) + one global Quick Add button**

* Board
* Calendar
* Chores
* Lists
* More
* Floating “+” for quick add (Event, Chore, List Item, Pickup)

This keeps kids and adults from getting lost.

---

## 6) Pickup and logistics

You can make this either its own tab or live inside Board. I’d still give it a dedicated screen for clarity.

### Screen: Pickups

Purpose: Prevent double-driving and missed pickups.

* Cards grouped by date
* Pickup card shows:

  * who: child/person
  * where: location
  * when: time
  * assigned driver (or unassigned)
  * status: planned | en route | done
* One-tap actions:

  * Claim
  * Mark En Route
  * Mark Done

### Screen: Pickup Details

* Person/child
* Location
* Time window
* Assigned driver
* Notes (gate code, “call when here”)
* Notification settings

---

## 7) More (settings and admin)

### Screen: More

Sections:

* Household Members
* Roles and permissions
* Modules toggles (enable/disable Pickups, Points, etc.)
* Notification preferences
* Support / Feedback
* Account

### Screen: Members and Roles

* Member list with role badge
* Invite member button
* Remove member (Admin only)
* Guest access toggles:

  * Can view calendar
  * Can view pickups
  * Can edit lists
  * Can complete chores

---

## Global: Quick Add

### Screen: Quick Add (modal)

Buttons:

* Add Event
* Add Chore
* Add List Item
* Add Pickup

Each opens a **single-screen create flow** with minimal required fields and an “Advanced” expander.

---

## MVP screen count (tight version)

If you want to keep it super lean, this is the minimum set:

1. Welcome / Create / Join
2. Board
3. Calendar + Event Details
4. Chores + Chore Details
5. Lists + List Detail
6. Pickups + Pickup Detail
7. More + Members/Roles

---

If you tell me your preference on one thing, I’ll lock the screen map into a clean IA spec: do you want **Pickups as its own tab**, or **only on Board** with a “See all pickups” link? Both work, but it changes the bottom nav.
